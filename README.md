## Quote-Server-XHR
Quote server based on the zyLab using XHR code, with alternate endpoint for Pat's Node.js version. 
- HTML comes straight from the lab
- JS is somewhat customized, with comments indicating changes and some explanation of functionality
- Note the comment on line 21, which allows the endpoint to be changed to the node.js server instead of zyBook's php app
